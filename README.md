mobbr angular app
=================

Using grunt for running and building the app:

1. install nodejs (see nodejs.org for binaries)
2. cd to project dir and do:
```
npm install -g grunt
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```
3. run the app with ```grunt server```
4. build the app with ```grunt build```. This minifies and concatenates resources and copies them to the ```/dist``` directory.
